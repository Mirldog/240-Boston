                Jobs of Boston
            </h1>
            <p>
                Competition is fierce in Boston, but because of this intense competition, the rewards are second to
                none. The business district of Boston is home to tons of companies, all ranging from small, startup type
                companies, all the way up to corporate giants. While Boston is an expensive city, the salaries make up
                for it. The average person in any industry at any level will make around $71,000 in salary. Lots of
                larger companies have been moving to Boston recently as well, so it is always a good place to get your
                foot in the door.

                    Amazon
                </h3>
                <p>
                    Just this past February, Amazon Services have moved their headquarters to Boston, thus bringing in
                    2,000 highly competitive and high paying jobs. Amazon made the move to Boston thanks to its great
                    schooling systems, high brain power, and booming technological economy. More and more tech companies
                    have made the move to Boston, and it has shown to pay dividends, as companies continue to thrive
                    on the Harbor.

                    Liberty Mutual
                </h3>
                <p>
                    You wouldn't expect to see liberty mutual on this list, considering their logo is a picture of the
                    Statue of Liberty. I certainly would have expected their HQ to be in NY. However their headquarters
                    are in Boston. Libery Mutual is an insurance agency. It is a fortune 500 company that employs over
                    50,000 people.

                    Boston Consulting Group
                </h3>
                <p>
                    The Boston Consulting Group is a multinational consulting firm. Consistently, BCG is ranked in the
                    top ten of "The Best Companies to Work at" by Forbes Magazine. Last year, the Boston Giant ranked
                    fourth. This is thanks to its positive work environment, and excellent employee benefits. You need
                    to be at the top of your game to land this job however, as Glassdoor.com ranks it the 3rd most
                    difficult company with which to interview.
