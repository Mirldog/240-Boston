                    Boston's Professional Sports
                </h1>
                <p>
                    Boston has a long history of sports, with different teams showing dominance in different eras, but
                    over the past decade, Boston sports have shown dominance across the board. It is an exciting time
                    to be a Boston sports fan. The four major teams in Boston are The Boston Red Sox for baseball,
                    The Boston Celtics for Basketball, The Boston Bruins for Hockey, and The New England Patriots for
                    Football.

                   Red Sox
                </h3>
                <p>
                    The Red Sox are a professional baseball team in the MLB. They compete in the American League East
                    Division, along with their long time rivals, The New York Yankees. The Yankees certainly have a
                    much more prestigious history, as they boast an impressive 27 rings since the clubs conception.
                    However in recent years, while the Yankees haven't been bad per-say, the Red Sox have simply been
                    better. Since 2004, the Red Sox have won 3 World Series titles, to the Yankees 1. In 2004, the Red
                    Sox were in an 86 year drought for a World Series. They were down 3-0 in a best of 7 game series to
                    the New York Yankees, only to come back and win the series 4-3 to get the Red Sox their first title
                    since 1918. This was regarded ast the greatest comeback in MLB history, and is widely regarded as
                    one of the greatest comebacks in all of sports history. The Red Sox are also back to back to back AL
                    East Champions, and are currently in contention for another World Series ring this year.

                    Celtics
                </h3>
                <p>
                    The Celtics are a professional basketball in the NBA. They compete in the Eastern Conference. Their
                    era of dominance ran through the 70's and 80's, where they dominated the league, and won a ring
                    seemingly almost yearly. The dynasty was also around in the 50's when Bill Russel was drafted. In
                    total, the Celtics own 17 Championships. While the team was rebuilding through the early 2010's,
                    the Celtics have been back in contention, signing a few big free agents in Kyrie Irving and Gordon
                    Hayward, as well as high quality draft picks in Jayson Tatum and Jaylen Brown, all behind mastermind
                    coach Brad Stevens, the Celtics are a championship caliber team looking to make their next trip
                    back to the Finals. The Celtics own the most championship titles in the league.

                    Bruins
                </h3>
                <p>
                    The Bruins are a professional hockey team in the NHL. They compete in the leagues Eastern
                    Conference. Arguably the least dominate of the four Boston teams, the Bruins are still a
                    consistently talented team, that no opposing team looks forward to playing against. They own 6
                    Stanley Cups, all fairly spread out in their history. The most recent victory came in 2011. They
                    are tied for fourth most Stanley Cups all time.
                </p>
                <h3 class="subsection">
                    Patriots
                </h3>
                <p>
                    The Patriots are a professional football team in the NFL. They compete in the AFC East. Their era
                    of dominance has reigned over the NFL since Tom Brady was selected to be quarter-back in 2001. Coach
                    Bill Belichick has brought the team to fruition, and year after year they are always the team to
                    beat. Since the beginning of the Brady-Belichick era, the patriots boast a .500 winning percentage
                    or better against every team in the league. In 2016, the patriots capped off their season with a
                    trip to the Super Bowl, and were getting blown out 28-3 deep into the third quarter. Everybody
                    thought the game was over, until Tom Brady led the Patriots to a comeback, to tie and send the game
                    to overtime for the first time in history, and then promptly win the Super Bowl right after, to cap
                    off the greatest comeback in football history.
