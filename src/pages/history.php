                History of Boston
            </h1>
            <p>
                Boston has an extremely rich history. As one of the oldest cities in America, there never seems to be
                an end to not only the well known text-book history, but also just simply old tales passed down through
                generations of Bostonians. Bostons history runs deep, and it can be seen through its citizens, and its
                landmarks left behind by our predecessors.

                    Early Settlers
                </h3>
                <p>
                    The earliest settlers came around 1620 from England. The original settlers struggled through the
                    cold New England winters, but eventually thrived to become a successful community. By 1630 the
                    first church was established by John Winthrop. Five years later, the first public school in
                    America was opened, Boston Latin. The Paul Revere House was also built around this time, in 1680
                    to be precise.

                    Boston Tea Party
                </h3>
                <div>
                    More than 5000 people from Boston and towns nearby pushed their way into the South Meeting house
                    on December 16, 1773. They demanded to know the fate of the East India Company Tea. The request
                    of the people was denied, and the crowd was furious. Several hundred men boarded the ships of
                    East India Company dumped 340 chests of East India Company tea into the Boston Harbor, later
                    to be known as the Boston Tea Party.
